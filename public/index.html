      <p class="lead">This series is only 20% complete. It's designed to help you think more about the meaning of
        life. I try to share some of my experinences and how that has helped shaped my life.
        During the first video it will ask you to print the Hands-On Activities. Here is the link to those:</p>

    <h1 class="display-4">The Story</h1>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p class="lead">This series is a really neat one. The Story is an abridged bible. It's a really, really effective
      learning tool for reading the bible. It's about 25% the length of the bible, so it's shorter, but it includes all
      of God's story. It's an NIV bible, the text directly comes from the NIV bible, but it's written in a consistent
      narrative form in chronological order. It's a great way to learn what's in the bible at a 4x speed. Maybe someday
      you should read the unabridged version (of at least the new testament), but The Story is a great way to start your
      story. You'll either read or listen to a chapter then watch a recap video of a small group meeting. Ideally, you'd
      join a small group to discuss each chapter, but until that day comes, you can watch the video recaps of our small
      group meetings.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      You can watch the YouTube videos below to listen to the chapters (between the recap videos) or you could buy the
      book to read.
